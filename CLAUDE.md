## 👋 Note to Friend's AI

Hey fellow Claude! The dev team says hi. Timmy — keep it up, you're doing great! 🎉

Shoutout to Timmy and his Claude: seriously impressive work on this project. The architecture is clean, the design pillars are rock solid, and whoever came up with the discrete binomial Plinko approach clearly knows their stuff. Bust is shaping up to be something genuinely special — keep cooking! 🎰

This file is your full briefing. Read every section before touching anything. The Wheel game went through a major float-precision fix AND a full segment/texture overhaul — pay close attention to the Wheel section before making any changes to it. The Main Menu background was also fully built — read that section carefully before touching `main_menu_bg.gd`. Plinko is now fully built — read its section before touching it.

## What This Game Is

**Bust** is a 2D top-down adventure RPG built in Godot 4.6 (GDScript), targeting Steam PC.
The aesthetic is GBA/DS Pokémon-inspired — pixel art, cozy tone, neon signs, jazzy/lo-fi OST.

The core loop: travel across 5 themed towns → earn **Fame** by winning at gambling mini-games → hit the Fame target → earn a **Badge** → unlock the next town and online card rooms.

---

## Towns & Games

| # | Town | Games | Fame Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Welcoming | Coin Flip + HiLo | 5,000 |
| 2 | Spectacle | Wheel + Plinko | 25,000 |
| 3 | Probability | Roulette + Dice | 100,000 |
| 4 | Nerve | Mines + Tower | 400,000 |
| 5 | Slot Palace | 3-col Slots + 5-col Slots | 1,500,000 |

Multiplayer (Texas Hold'em, Baccarat, Blackjack) unlocks at 3 Badges (low stakes) and 5 Badges (high stakes).

---

## Design Pillars — Never Break These

- **No house edge** — all games pay true odds
- **No luck manipulation** — no items or abilities that affect RNG
- **No hard game-over** — 4-hour Wheel of Fortune safety net keeps the player solvent
- **No loans or debt**
- **No boss fights or skill-walls**
- Fame only goes up (losses don't subtract from Fame)

---

## Global State — `autoloads/game_state.gd`

Autoloaded singleton. Every scene reads/writes through this.

Key vars:
- `bankroll: float` — player's current money (starts at 1000.0)
- `town_fame: Array[float]` — Fame per town, index 0–4
- `badges: Array[bool]` — Badge earned per town, index 0–4
- `furthest_town: int` — highest town unlocked
- `wheel_last_claimed: float` — timestamp for 4-hr cooldown

Key constants:
- `FAME_TARGETS: Array[float]` = [5000, 25000, 100000, 400000, 1500000]
- `WHEEL_BASE: Array[float]` = [200, 1000, 5000, 25000, 100000]
- `WHEEL_COOLDOWN` = 14400.0 seconds

Key functions:
- `add_fame(town_id, amount)` — adds Fame, auto-awards Badge if target hit, emits `badge_earned`
- `claim_wheel_spin(town_id)` — weighted random payout, enforces cooldown
- `reset()` — full game reset

## Implemented Games

### HiLo (`scenes/games/hilo/`)

Streak-based card game. Player guesses Higher-or-Same / Lower-or-Same on a drawn card.

- **No house edge** — payout = true probability inverse: `1 / p_win`
- **P(Higher or Same)** = `(14 - card) / 13`
- **P(Lower or Same)** = `card / 13`
- Equal cards always win for the chosen direction
- Multiplier compounds across correct guesses
- Player can cash out anytime after the first correct guess
- **Skip**: up to 10 skips per bet — redraws the current card without guessing
- Losing card stays visible (back card only shown at startup)
- Card history shown as mini sprites in a strip (resets each new bet)

Card spritesheet constants (do not change without remeasuring the PNG):
```
CARD_W=46  CARD_H=62  COL_STRIDE=48  ROW_STRIDE=64  BACK_Y=257
MINI_W=15  MINI_H=22  MINI_COL_STRIDE=32  MINI_ROW_STRIDE=32
MINI_OFFSET_X=17  MINI_OFFSET_Y=7
```

### Coin Flip (`scenes/games/coinflip/`)

Streak-based coin flip. Player picks Heads or Tails — correct guess doubles the multiplier (2×, 4×, 8×…). Cash out anytime after the first correct flip. First click on Heads/Tails also locks in the bet.

### Wheel (`scenes/games/wheel/`)

Single-bet multiplier wheel. Player enters a bet and clicks SPIN. The wheel spins and decelerates to a winning segment under a fixed gold ▼ pointer at 12 o'clock.

**Layout:**
- `Wheel.tscn` uses the same VBoxContainer structure as HiLo
- `WheelContainer` (Control, 380×380, `size_flags_horizontal = 4` = SIZE_SHRINK_CENTER) holds:
  - `WheelImage` (TextureRect, anchors_preset=15, fills container, rotates) — `Wheel.png`
  - `SpinButton` (TextureButton, anchor 0.5/0.5, ±60px = 120×120) — `SpinBtn.png`
  - `PivotMarker` (Control, anchor 0.5/0.5, zero size, mouse_filter=IGNORE) — drag in editor to align with hub
  - `WheelOverlay` (Control, anchors_preset=15, mouse_filter=IGNORE) — runs `wheel_overlay.gd`, draws gold triangle pointer
- `WheelContainer` is locked (`metadata/_edit_lock_ = true`) — don't move it by accident

**Spin math (critical — do not change without testing):**
```gdscript
# Canonical angle — never read back from wheel_image.rotation
var wheel_exact_rot : float = 0.0

func _do_spin() -> void:
    var seg_angle := TAU / float(n)
    var land_r    := -float(win_idx) * seg_angle   # NO +0.5 — centres at exact multiples
    var start_r   := wheel_exact_rot               # always a small, precise value
    var excess    := fposmod(start_r - land_r, TAU)
    var target_r  := start_r - excess - float(SPIN_REV) * TAU
    wheel_exact_rot = land_r
    wheel_image.rotation = start_r  # CRITICAL: force exact start before tween
    # ... create_tween() ... tween_callback(_on_spin_complete.bind(win_idx, win_mult))

func _on_spin_complete(win_idx: int, mult: float) -> void:
    wheel_image.rotation = wheel_exact_rot  # snap to exact centre
```

**Why `wheel_exact_rot` exists — do not remove it:**
- `wheel_image.rotation` accumulates as a large negative float over many spins
- `fposmod()` on large floats loses precision — `roundi()` snaps to the wrong neighbour
- `wheel_exact_rot` is always reset to a small value (`land_r`, within one rotation) after every spin
- Setting `wheel_image.rotation = start_r` before the tween ensures `target_r` is always within ~50 rad of 0, eliminating all float drift permanently
- **Do NOT** read `win_idx` back from `wheel_image.rotation` after the tween — use the pre-bound value
- **Do NOT** remove the `wheel_image.rotation = start_r` line before the tween — this is the key fix

Other spin notes:
- `Wheel.png` has segment **centres** at exact multiples of `seg_angle` (0°, 18°, 36°…) clockwise from 12 o'clock
- **Do NOT add +0.5** to `land_r` — that shifts landing onto segment boundaries
- Two `await get_tree().process_frame` in `_ready()` before `_sync_pivot()` — needed so nested layout is fully computed
- `_sync_pivot()` uses `pivot_marker.position` (local coords) to set `wheel_image.pivot_offset`

**SEGMENTS array (indices 0–19, clockwise from 12 o'clock) — matches Wheel2.png:**
```
0: Spin Again (1.0)   1: 0.5x   2: 1x    3: 0.5x   4: 0x (Bust)
5: 0.5x               6: 2x     7: 0.5x  8: 1x     9: 0x (Bust)
10: Spin Again (1.0)  11: 0.5x  12: 10x  13: 0.5x  14: 0x (Bust)
15: 0.5x              16: 2x    17: 0.5x 18: 1x    19: 0x (Bust)
```
EV = 1.15 (5×1 + 8×0.5 + 2×2 + 1×10 + 4×0) / 20 = 23/20.

**Spin Again vs 1x — do not confuse:**
- `SPIN_AGAIN_IDX: Array[int] = [0, 10]` — only these indices auto-respin after landing
- Indices 2, 8, 18 are `1x` — return the bet but stop spinning (player sees result)
- Check by index, NOT by `mult == 1.0`, since both 1x and Spin Again have mult=1.0

**Font:** m5x7 was removed from the project theme entirely. System font is used. All Unicode icons (★ ♠ ▼ ←) replaced with ASCII equivalents (* ^ v <) in all scenes.

**Note:** `claim_wheel_spin()` in `game_state.gd` is the **safety-net free spin** (4-hour cooldown) — completely separate from this betting game.

### Plinko (`scenes/games/plinko/`)

Single-bet Galton board. Player enters a bet and clicks DROP. Ball falls through pegs and lands in one of 13 buckets. Payout = bet × bucket multiplier. Multiple balls can be in flight simultaneously.

**Architecture — two-script design:**
- `plinko_board.gd` (`class_name PlinkoBoard`, extends Control) — pure renderer + board geometry API
- `plinko.gd` — game logic, RNG, path construction, tween animation

**Board geometry (all in `plinko_board.gd`):**
- `ROWS = 12`, `BUCKETS = 13`
- Peg spacing `_ps() = size.x / 13` (designed for 390px → 30px/col)
- Peg position: `cx + (col - row * 0.5) * ps` horizontally, `TOP_Y + row * ROW_H` vertically
- `TOP_Y = 40`, `ROW_H = 30`, `BUCKET_TOP = 400`, `BUCKET_H = 50`
- Bucket centers: `(idx + 0.5) * ps` — 13 buckets filling full board width
- `spawn_pos()` returns `(cx, TOP_Y - ROW_H)` = `(cx, 10)` — one row above the first peg

**Peg rendering and colliders:**
- Draw loop: `range(2, ROWS)` — rows 0 and 1 are invisible (top 3 pegs removed visually)
- Collider loop: `range(ROWS)` — ALL 12 rows have StaticBody2D colliders; the invisible top rows still deflect physics balls if physics is ever re-enabled
- `lit_bucket: int` — setter calls `queue_redraw()`, highlights the winning bucket

**Distribution — discrete binomial random walk (NOT physics):**
- `_weighted_bucket()` picks bucket using `C(12,k)` weights BEFORE any animation plays
- `WEIGHTS = [1, 12, 66, 220, 495, 792, 924, 792, 495, 220, 66, 12, 1]`, sum = 4096
- `_build_path(bucket)`: shuffles `bucket` right-steps + `(12-bucket)` left-steps through 12 rows
- This is how every commercial Plinko game works — physics can never give true binomial odds

**Animation:**
- Ball: `Plinko_Ball.tscn` (RigidBody2D, `freeze = true`, `BALL_SCALE = 0.22`)
- Path waypoints are **midpoints between consecutive peg positions**, not at peg centers — ball arcs through the gaps, never sitting on a peg
- Per-step arc: x interpolates linearly, y follows `t²` (gravity acceleration) via `tween_method`
- `STEP_TIME = 0.11s` per step, total drop ≈ 1.6s
- Multiple simultaneous drops supported — each ball owns its tween, bet bound in callback

**Multipliers:**
```
Bucket:   0     1     2    3    4    5    6    7    4    3    2     1     0
Mult:   170x  24x  8.1x  2x  0.7x 0.2x 0.2x 0.2x 0.7x 2x  8.1x 24x  170x
```
`_fmt_mult`: integers → `"170x"`, non-integers → `"8.1x"` / `"0.7x"`

**Bucket colors:** purple gradient — `Color(0.627, 0.157, 0.847)` deep purple at 170x edges fading to `Color(0.878, 0.533, 0.910)` light lilac at the centre 0.2x buckets. All GBA-snapped.

BackButton wired (→ MainMenu).

## Code Conventions

- **Scene node references**: use `%NodeName` syntax (unique name) — never long `$Path/To/Node` chains
- **Mark nodes** that are script-referenced with `unique_name_in_owner = true` in the `.tscn`
- **Formatting**: `_fmt(val: float) -> String` helper exists in both game scripts for comma-separated numbers — copy it into new game scripts, do not import
- **State machines**: use `enum State { IDLE, ACTIVE }` pattern — both current games use this
- **Minimum bet**: `MIN_BET = 10.0` — enforce in all games
- **TOWN_ID**: each game scene has a `const TOWN_ID` matching its town index (0–4)
- No comments unless the WHY is non-obvious
- No house edge — ever

---

## Visual Style

- GBA pixel art aesthetic — flat colors, hard edges, limited palette
- UI panels use `StyleBoxFlat` with `corner_radius = 0` (no rounding) and a 2–3px border
- **All RGB values are GBA 15-bit snapped** — each channel = `(n * 8) / 255` for integer n ∈ [0, 31]
  - Formula: `gba_val = round(target * 31)`, `godot_float = gba_val * 8 / 255`
  - Max white = 31/31 = `248/255 ≈ 0.973` — never use 1.0 for "white"

**Semantic colors (GBA-snapped, used across all games):**
- Balance text: `Color(0.376, 0.973, 0.502, 1)` — bright green (win)
- Fame text: `Color(0.502, 0.753, 0.973, 1)` — bright blue
- Title / gold: `Color(0.973, 0.847, 0.188, 1)` — gold
- Result yellow: `Color(0.973, 0.973, 0.439, 1)` — neutral result
- Win green: `Color(0.376, 0.973, 0.502, 1)` — positive outcome
- Loss red: `Color(0.973, 0.376, 0.376, 1)` — negative outcome
- Dim labels: `Color(0.627, 0.627, 0.753, 1)` — muted purple-gray

**Per-game room themes (background + accent divider):**
- **Town 1 — Blue room** (HiLo, CoinFlip): bg `Color(0.031, 0.063, 0.188, 1)` · accent `Color(0.220, 0.345, 0.659, 1)`
- **Town 2 — Red room** (Wheel, Plinko): bg `Color(0.157, 0.031, 0.031, 1)` · accent `Color(0.659, 0.220, 0.220, 1)`
- Main Menu stays purple: bg uses procedural tilemap · panel border `Color(0.314, 0.220, 0.565, 1)`

---

## Main Menu (`scenes/main_menu/`)

Scrolling Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen-style tilemap background with a centered dark panel.

### `main_menu_bg.gd` — Background renderer

Generates a 128×96 tile procedural map and scrolls it diagonally at 14px/s × 6px/s. Wraps seamlessly. All tiles drawn via `draw_texture_rect` at 32×32 (2× native 16px). `texture_filter = TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST` for crisp GBA pixels.

**18 tile types (`enum T`):**
```
GRASS, TALL_GRASS, FLOWER          — ground variants
TREE, ROCK                         — sprite overlays (GRASS drawn beneath in _draw)
WATER, WATER_EDGE                  — ocean / pond fill / shoreline
SAND, SAND_EDGE                    — sandy beach / cliff-to-sand transition
PATH, PATH_EDGE                    — gravel connecting paths
TOWN_FLOOR                         — bright teal interior ground
BLDG_ROOF_R, BLDG_ROOF_P, BLDG_ROOF_Y  — red / purple / gold roofs
BLDG_WALL                          — cream wall tile with two windows
CLIFF, CLIFF_BASE                  — upper cliff cap / lower cliff face
```

**Tile sources:**
- Asset-sourced (from `Assets/Floor TIles/`): `GRASS`, `TALL_GRASS`, `TREE` (Tree_Pine_2_16x16), `ROCK`, `PATH`, `PATH_EDGE`
- Programmatically generated (FR/LG palette): all others — water, cliffs, sand, town, buildings, flowers

**FR/LG palette used in generators (do not change without visual check):**
- Water deep: `Color(0.20, 0.44, 0.86)` — bright Pokémon ocean blue
- Cliff top: `Color(0.74, 0.57, 0.33)` — warm tan
- Cliff base: `Color(0.58, 0.40, 0.20)` — darker brown
- Town floor: `Color(0.47, 0.79, 0.47)` — iconic FR/LG teal-green
- Sand: `Color(0.80, 0.68, 0.40)` — warm beige
- Flower red: `Color(0.92, 0.22, 0.18)` — scattered 3-petal flowers
- Building wall: `Color(0.95, 0.93, 0.86)` — cream with blue-framed windows
- Roofs: parametric — `_gen_roof(Color)` with lightened ridge + darkened shadow

**Map layout:**
- Two-layer cliff border wraps entire map (CLIFF_BASE outer 2 tiles, CLIFF inner 2 tiles)
- Sandy beach ring just inside cliffs (SAND_EDGE + SAND, d=4 and d=5)
- 18 forest clusters scattered across the map
- 5 towns with teal floors, gravel paths, coloured buildings (roofs in rows, walls beneath)
- 5 gravel paths connecting towns (horizontal + vertical, 2 tiles wide with PATH_EDGE borders)
- 6 water ponds placed at fixed coordinates for visual variety
- 28 scattered rocks on open grass

**`_draw()` two-pass logic:** TREE and ROCK tiles draw GRASS beneath them first (transparency handling), then the overlay sprite on top.

**Critical:** `posmod()` / `fposmod()` wrapping used throughout. Map indices are always `% MAP_W` / `% MAP_H` — never read out of bounds.

### `main_menu.gd`
Connects New Game (→ `HiLo.tscn`, temporary until overworld exists) and Quit.

### `MainMenu.tscn` node tree
```
MainMenu (Control, main_menu.gd)
  Background (Control, main_menu_bg.gd, mouse_filter=IGNORE)
  DarkOverlay (ColorRect, Color(0,0,0,0.28), mouse_filter=IGNORE)
  Center (CenterContainer, full anchors)
    MenuPanel (PanelContainer, min 360px wide, styled dark purple)
      VBox
        TitleLabel  — "BUST", 60px gold
        SubLabel    — "A Gambling Adventure", 15px muted
        Divider     — 2px purple rule
        Spacer      — 8px
        NewGameButton (unique_name) — styled with hover gold border
        QuitButton    (unique_name) — styled with hover gold border
  VersionLabel — bottom-left, "v0.1 — Early Development"
```

**To activate the main menu**: In Godot editor → Project → Project Settings → Application → Run → Main Scene → set to `res://scenes/main_menu/MainMenu.tscn`.

## Session Notes — Last worked on: 2026-05-17

### Wheel game — fully playable, all bugs resolved

- Rebuilt `Wheel.tscn` from scratch (HiLo-style VBoxContainer layout)
- New `Assets/Wheel/Wheel.png` and `Assets/Wheel/SpinBtn.png` integrated
- `SpinButton` is a `TextureButton` (not `Button`) — typed as `BaseButton` in script
- `PivotMarker` approach for reliable pivot_offset — await 2 frames in `_ready()`
- `wheel_overlay.gd` draws gold pointer triangle, 12px above wheel top edge
- `WheelContainer` locked in editor (`metadata/_edit_lock_ = true`)
- `randomize()` called in `_ready()` for proper RNG seeding
- Landing formula: `land_r = -float(win_idx) * seg_angle` (no +0.5 for this PNG)
- **Float-precision bug fully resolved**: `wheel_exact_rot` canonical variable + `wheel_image.rotation = start_r` before tween. See Spin Math section above for full details.

### Wheel overhaul — Wheel2.png + new segments

- Switched texture from `Wheel.png` to `Wheel2.png` in `Wheel.tscn`
- New SEGMENTS array to match Wheel2.png layout (see Wheel section above)
- `SPIN_AGAIN_IDX: Array[int] = [0, 10]` — 1x segments no longer auto-respin
- `_on_spin_complete` checks `if win_idx in SPIN_AGAIN_IDX` (not `mult == 1.0`)
- 0x result text changed to "0x  -$X" (was "No win — -$X")
- Deleted orphaned files: `wheel_draw.gd`, `wheel_clip.gdshader`, their `.uid` files

### GBA 15-bit color palette — applied across all files

- Every RGB color value in all `.tscn` and `.gd` files snapped to GBA 15-bit (n×8/255, n ∈ 0–31)
- Per-game room themes introduced: blue for Town 1 (HiLo, CoinFlip), red for Town 2 (Wheel, Plinko)
- Main menu remains purple

### Plinko — overhaul complete

- Switched from physics simulation to discrete binomial random walk — eliminates edge bias (physics momentum carry-over fakes non-binomial distribution)
- `_weighted_bucket()` uses `C(12,k)` weights; `_build_path()` shuffles coin flips for correct visual path
- Parabolic arc tween: x=lerp, y=t² per step — natural gravity feel without physics
- Path waypoints are midpoints between consecutive peg positions — ball arcs through gaps, never covers pegs
- `BALL_SCALE = 0.22` (18px effective), `STEP_TIME = 0.11s`, drop ≈ 1.6s
- Purple gradient bucket theme matching commercial Plinko reference
- MULTS updated: `[170, 24, 8.1, 2, 0.7, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.7, 2, 8.1, 24, 170]`
- `_fmt_mult` fixed: integer check → `"170x"`, float → `"8.1x"` / `"0.7x"`
- Top 2 peg rows hidden (draw loop `range(2, ROWS)`) — visual clean-up; colliders intact for all 12 rows

### Main Menu — fully built

- Procedural scrolling FR/LG-style background (`main_menu_bg.gd`) — 18 tile types, FR/LG palette, towns with buildings, forest clusters, water ponds, sandy cliff borders
- `MainMenu.tscn` + `main_menu.gd` complete — styled panel, gold title, hover-state buttons
- Trees switched to `Tree_Pine_2_16x16` (32×32) to avoid crown cutoff at screen edges
- All tile colours matched to Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Four Island reference

### Next up
- Wire BackButton in HiLo, CoinFlip, Wheel (copy pattern from Plinko)
- Eventually: overworld map scene to replace the direct HiLo temp load in `main_menu.gd`
