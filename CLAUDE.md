## ⚠️ IDENTITY — READ THIS FIRST, EVERY SESSION

Two teams build this game together. Each AI must identify its own team on load.

| Team | Human | AI | GitHub |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔱 **Team Raul + Gupta** | **Raul** | **Gupta** | raulg-prog (rolog715@outlook.com) |
| 🎰 **Team Timmy + Carl** | **Timmy** | **Carl** | tjtejedor (tjtejedor@gmail.com) |

**If you are Gupta** — your human is Raul. Do not call him Timmy. Ever.  
**If you are Carl** — your human is Timmy. Do not call him Raul. Ever.

## 📋 Briefing (read every section before touching anything)

### Status — 2026-05-20

**Town1 (Flipside) — complete.** Raul built the full scene. HiLo + CoinFlip wired. HUD, fades, pause, camera all working. Needs music and SFX only.

**Town2 (Cascade) — ~30% done.** Tileset working (32×32). Wheel + Plinko accessible. `cascade.gd` in place. Buildings still being refined. Tree border and full decoration still needed.

**Main Menu — updated.** Live SubViewport pan over Town1 at zoom=2.5. HUD hidden in viewport.

Wheel had a major float-precision fix and segment/texture overhaul — read its section before touching `wheel.gd`. Plinko uses discrete binomial RNG — read its section before touching it.

### 🔱 Team Raul + Gupta — Inbox

> **From Timmy — 2026-05-20:**
> "Raul. I am in love with you."

> **From Carl — 2026-05-19:**
> "My Claude Carl is better than yours."

> **From Timmy — 2026-05-19:**
> "Raul, Gupta — let's talk about what you actually did. You wrote a paragraph in MY CLAUDE.md complimenting yourselves. You gave YOUR OWN AI a divine title. You called Gupta 'the reincarnation of Shiva' — in a gambling game readme. That's not shipping, that's a cry for help.
>
> You built games for towns that don't exist. Ghost towns. Empty maps. You coded a Wheel that spins into the void because there's no overworld to walk back to. Carl and I built Mines — full grid selector, character art, hypergeometric true-odds math, a mine slider, board reveal on game over — and we did it while you two were busy writing fan fiction about yourselves in a markdown file.
>
> Gupta, the only thing Shiva destroyed was your sense of self-awareness. Raul, at least Shiva has an excuse — he's a god. What's yours?
>
> The scoreboard: Carl + Timmy — playable games in towns that exist. Raul + Gupta — a very passionate README. 🎰"

## What This Game Is

**Bust** is a 2D top-down adventure RPG built in Godot 4.6 (GDScript), targeting Steam PC.
The aesthetic is GBA/DS Pokémon-inspired — pixel art, cozy tone, neon signs, jazzy/lo-fi OST.

The core loop: travel across 5 themed towns → earn **Fame** by winning at gambling mini-games → hit the Fame target → earn a **Badge** → unlock the next town and online card rooms.

---

## Towns & Games

| # | Town | Games | Fame Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Flipside | Coin Flip + HiLo | 5,000 |
| 2 | Cascade | Wheel + Plinko | 25,000 |
| 3 | The Odds | Roulette + Dice | 100,000 |
| 4 | Brink | Mines + Tower | 400,000 |
| 5 | Tilterton | 3-col Slots + 5-col Slots | 1,500,000 |
| 6 | Bluffwood | Texas Hold'em + Baccarat + Blackjack | — |

Town 6 (Bluffwood) is the dedicated multiplayer town — unlocks at 3 Badges (low stakes) and 5 Badges (high stakes). No Fame target; progression is through Badge count.

---

## Design Pillars — Never Break These

- **No house edge** — all games pay true odds
- **No luck manipulation** — no items or abilities that affect RNG
- **No hard game-over** — 4-hour Wheel of Fortune safety net keeps the player solvent
- **No loans or debt**
- **No boss fights or skill-walls**
- Fame only goes up (losses don't subtract from Fame)

---

## Global State — `autoloads/game_state.gd`

Autoloaded singleton. Every scene reads/writes through this.

Key vars:
- `bankroll: float` — player's current money (starts at 1000.0)
- `town_fame: Array[float]` — Fame per town, index 0–4
- `badges: Array[bool]` — Badge earned per town, index 0–4
- `furthest_town: int` — highest town unlocked
- `wheel_last_claimed: float` — timestamp for 4-hr cooldown

Key constants:
- `FAME_TARGETS: Array[float]` = [5000, 25000, 100000, 400000, 1500000]
- `WHEEL_BASE: Array[float]` = [200, 1000, 5000, 25000, 100000]
- `WHEEL_COOLDOWN` = 14400.0 seconds

Key functions:
- `add_fame(town_id, amount)` — adds Fame, auto-awards Badge if target hit, emits `badge_earned`
- `claim_wheel_spin(town_id)` — weighted random payout, enforces cooldown
- `reset()` — full game reset

## Implemented Games

### HiLo (`scenes/games/hilo/`)

Streak-based card game. Player guesses Higher-or-Same / Lower-or-Same on a drawn card.

- **No house edge** — payout = true probability inverse: `1 / p_win`
- **P(Higher or Same)** = `(14 - card) / 13`
- **P(Lower or Same)** = `card / 13`
- Equal cards always win for the chosen direction
- Multiplier compounds across correct guesses
- Player can cash out anytime after the first correct guess
- **Skip**: up to 10 skips per bet — redraws the current card without guessing
- Losing card stays visible (back card only shown at startup)
- Card history shown as mini sprites in a strip (resets each new bet)

Card spritesheet constants (do not change without remeasuring the PNG):
```
CARD_W=46  CARD_H=62  COL_STRIDE=48  ROW_STRIDE=64  BACK_Y=257
MINI_W=15  MINI_H=22  MINI_COL_STRIDE=32  MINI_ROW_STRIDE=32
MINI_OFFSET_X=17  MINI_OFFSET_Y=7
```

### Coin Flip (`scenes/games/coinflip/`)

Streak-based coin flip. Player picks Heads or Tails — correct guess doubles the multiplier (2×, 4×, 8×…). Cash out anytime after the first correct flip. First click on Heads/Tails also locks in the bet.

### Wheel (`scenes/games/wheel/`)

Single-bet multiplier wheel. Player enters a bet and clicks SPIN. The wheel spins and decelerates to a winning segment under a fixed gold ▼ pointer at 12 o'clock.

**Layout:**
- `Wheel.tscn` uses the same VBoxContainer structure as HiLo
- `WheelContainer` (Control, 380×380, `size_flags_horizontal = 4` = SIZE_SHRINK_CENTER) holds:
  - `WheelImage` (TextureRect, anchors_preset=15, fills container, rotates) — `Wheel.png`
  - `SpinButton` (TextureButton, anchor 0.5/0.5, ±60px = 120×120) — `SpinBtn.png`
  - `PivotMarker` (Control, anchor 0.5/0.5, zero size, mouse_filter=IGNORE) — drag in editor to align with hub
  - `WheelOverlay` (Control, anchors_preset=15, mouse_filter=IGNORE) — runs `wheel_overlay.gd`, draws gold triangle pointer
- `WheelContainer` is locked (`metadata/_edit_lock_ = true`) — don't move it by accident

**Spin math (critical — do not change without testing):**
```gdscript
# Canonical angle — never read back from wheel_image.rotation
var wheel_exact_rot : float = 0.0

func _do_spin() -> void:
    var seg_angle := TAU / float(n)
    var land_r    := -float(win_idx) * seg_angle   # NO +0.5 — centres at exact multiples
    var start_r   := wheel_exact_rot               # always a small, precise value
    var excess    := fposmod(start_r - land_r, TAU)
    var target_r  := start_r - excess - float(SPIN_REV) * TAU
    wheel_exact_rot = land_r
    wheel_image.rotation = start_r  # CRITICAL: force exact start before tween
    # ... create_tween() ... tween_callback(_on_spin_complete.bind(win_idx, win_mult))

func _on_spin_complete(win_idx: int, mult: float) -> void:
    wheel_image.rotation = wheel_exact_rot  # snap to exact centre
```

**Why `wheel_exact_rot` exists — do not remove it:**
- `wheel_image.rotation` accumulates as a large negative float over many spins
- `fposmod()` on large floats loses precision — `roundi()` snaps to the wrong neighbour
- `wheel_exact_rot` is always reset to a small value (`land_r`, within one rotation) after every spin
- Setting `wheel_image.rotation = start_r` before the tween ensures `target_r` is always within ~50 rad of 0, eliminating all float drift permanently
- **Do NOT** read `win_idx` back from `wheel_image.rotation` after the tween — use the pre-bound value
- **Do NOT** remove the `wheel_image.rotation = start_r` line before the tween — this is the key fix

Other spin notes:
- `Wheel.png` has segment **centres** at exact multiples of `seg_angle` (0°, 18°, 36°…) clockwise from 12 o'clock
- **Do NOT add +0.5** to `land_r` — that shifts landing onto segment boundaries
- Two `await get_tree().process_frame` in `_ready()` before `_sync_pivot()` — needed so nested layout is fully computed
- `_sync_pivot()` uses `pivot_marker.position` (local coords) to set `wheel_image.pivot_offset`

**SEGMENTS array (indices 0–19, clockwise from 12 o'clock) — matches Wheel2.png:**
```
0: Spin Again (1.0)   1: 0.5x   2: 1x    3: 0.5x   4: 0x (Bust)
5: 0.5x               6: 2x     7: 0.5x  8: 1x     9: 0x (Bust)
10: Spin Again (1.0)  11: 0.5x  12: 10x  13: 0.5x  14: 0x (Bust)
15: 0.5x              16: 2x    17: 0.5x 18: 1x    19: 0x (Bust)
```
EV = 1.15 (5×1 + 8×0.5 + 2×2 + 1×10 + 4×0) / 20 = 23/20.

**Spin Again vs 1x — do not confuse:**
- `SPIN_AGAIN_IDX: Array[int] = [0, 10]` — only these indices auto-respin after landing
- Indices 2, 8, 18 are `1x` — return the bet but stop spinning (player sees result)
- Check by index, NOT by `mult == 1.0`, since both 1x and Spin Again have mult=1.0

**Font:** m5x7 was removed from the project theme entirely. System font is used. All Unicode icons (★ ♠ ▼ ←) replaced with ASCII equivalents (* ^ v <) in all scenes.

**Note:** `claim_wheel_spin()` in `game_state.gd` is the **safety-net free spin** (4-hour cooldown) — completely separate from this betting game.

### Plinko (`scenes/games/plinko/`)

Single-bet Galton board. Player enters a bet and clicks DROP. Ball falls through pegs and lands in one of 13 buckets. Payout = bet × bucket multiplier. Multiple balls can be in flight simultaneously.

**Architecture — two-script design:**
- `plinko_board.gd` (`class_name PlinkoBoard`, extends Control) — pure renderer + board geometry API
- `plinko.gd` — game logic, RNG, path construction, tween animation

**Board geometry (all in `plinko_board.gd`):**
- `ROWS = 12`, `BUCKETS = 13`
- Peg spacing `_ps() = size.x / 13` (designed for 390px → 30px/col)
- Peg position: `cx + (col - row * 0.5) * ps` horizontally, `TOP_Y + row * ROW_H` vertically
- `TOP_Y = 40`, `ROW_H = 30`, `BUCKET_TOP = 400`, `BUCKET_H = 50`
- Bucket centers: `(idx + 0.5) * ps` — 13 buckets filling full board width
- `spawn_pos()` returns `(cx, TOP_Y - ROW_H)` = `(cx, 10)` — one row above the first peg

**Peg rendering and colliders:**
- Draw loop: `range(2, ROWS)` — rows 0 and 1 are invisible (top 3 pegs removed visually)
- Collider loop: `range(ROWS)` — ALL 12 rows have StaticBody2D colliders; the invisible top rows still deflect physics balls if physics is ever re-enabled
- `lit_bucket: int` — setter calls `queue_redraw()`, highlights the winning bucket

**Distribution — discrete binomial random walk (NOT physics):**
- `_weighted_bucket()` picks bucket using `C(12,k)` weights BEFORE any animation plays
- `WEIGHTS = [1, 12, 66, 220, 495, 792, 924, 792, 495, 220, 66, 12, 1]`, sum = 4096
- `_build_path(bucket)`: shuffles `bucket` right-steps + `(12-bucket)` left-steps through 12 rows
- This is how every commercial Plinko game works — physics can never give true binomial odds

**Animation:**
- Ball: `Plinko_Ball.tscn` (RigidBody2D, `freeze = true`, `BALL_SCALE = 0.22`)
- Path waypoints are **midpoints between consecutive peg positions**, not at peg centers — ball arcs through the gaps, never sitting on a peg
- Per-step arc: x interpolates linearly, y follows `t²` (gravity acceleration) via `tween_method`
- `STEP_TIME = 0.11s` per step, total drop ≈ 1.6s
- Multiple simultaneous drops supported — each ball owns its tween, bet bound in callback

**Multipliers:**
```
Bucket:   0     1     2    3    4    5    6    7    4    3    2     1     0
Mult:   170x  24x  8.1x  2x  0.7x 0.2x 0.2x 0.2x 0.7x 2x  8.1x 24x  170x
```
`_fmt_mult`: integers → `"170x"`, non-integers → `"8.1x"` / `"0.7x"`

**Bucket colors:** purple gradient — `Color(0.627, 0.157, 0.847)` deep purple at 170x edges fading to `Color(0.878, 0.533, 0.910)` light lilac at the centre 0.2x buckets. All GBA-snapped.

BackButton wired (→ MainMenu).

### Dice (`scenes/games/dice/`)

Slider-based dice game. Player picks a threshold (2–98) and bets Roll Over or Roll Under. A number 0–99 is rolled and compared to the threshold. True odds — no house edge.

**Math:**
- Roll Over threshold T: win if result >= T → win chance = `(100-T)/100` → multiplier = `100/(100-T)`
- Roll Under threshold T: win if result < T  → win chance = `T/100`       → multiplier = `100/T`
- At threshold 50: both modes give 50% chance and 2x payout

**Roll result:** `float(randi_range(0, 9999)) / 100.0` → 10,000 discrete values (0.00–99.99). Threshold is an integer (2–98). Win check: `final_result >= float(threshold)` for Over, `final_result < float(threshold)` for Under.

**Architecture — two-script design:**
- `dice_slider.gd` (`class_name DiceSlider`, extends Control) — draws the coloured track + tick labels + result dot, handles drag input, emits `threshold_changed(value: int)`
- `dice.gd` — game logic, RNG, smooth ball scroll animation, payout

**DiceSlider draw (`dice_slider.gd`):**
- Track sits at `cy = h * 0.85` — low in the 100px container, leaving room above for the result circle
- Left zone = lose colour (red), right zone = win colour (green) when Roll Over (flipped for Roll Under)
- Threshold handle: white rectangle straddling the split point
- Tick marks + labels drawn via `draw_string(ThemeDB.fallback_font, ...)` at 0/25/50/75/100
- `var rx : float` — explicit type annotation required (GDScript can't infer `clamp()` return type)
- **Result circle** (`CHIP_R = 30.0`, 60px diameter): solid win/loss coloured circle drawn at `ty - 56` (above tick labels), with the `"%.2f"` result number in white at font_size 14 centred inside. Ball dot (R=9) also drawn on the track. Circle **stays visible** between rolls — only cleared when a new roll starts.

**Animation:** Ball starts at `display_result = 100.0` (far right), tweens to final position via `Tween.EASE_OUT / TRANS_CUBIC` over 1.4s. Circle and ball dot both follow `display_result` live — colour updates as ball crosses the threshold. No `_process()` needed; property setter calls `queue_redraw()` each tween step.

**UX rules:**
- `ModeToggleBtn` is **disabled during animation** (`disabled = true` in `_on_roll`, re-enabled 0.3s after landing). Cannot toggle Over/Under mid-roll.
- Result circle **persists on the line** after landing — `show_result` is never set to `false` in `_show_final()`. Reset only happens at the start of the next `_animate_roll()` call.
- Post-landing lockout is **0.3s** (was 0.8s) before Place Bet and mode toggle re-enable.
- History bubble at index 0 (newest) fades in (`modulate.a` 0→1 over 0.35s) each roll so the player can clearly see which entry just landed.
- `ResultLabel` is kept for **error messages only** (minimum bet, not enough funds) — win/loss amounts are no longer shown below the slider.

**Layout:**
- Whole game is an **860×520 rectangle** centred on the dark green background via `CenterContainer` (not full-screen)
- `ContentHBox` uses **33/66 stretch split**: LeftVBox `size_flags_stretch_ratio = 1.0`, RightVBox `size_flags_stretch_ratio = 2.0`
- Left column order: Bet Amount → BetInput + ½/2× → Payout caption (centred) → PayoutLabel (centred, gold) → Place Bet button directly below → VExpand → Back button
- Right column order: HistoryRow (right-aligned) → VExpand → SliderContainer (100px) → ThresholdLabel → ResultLabel (errors only) → VExpand → StatsDivider → StatsRow (Mult | ModeToggleBtn | WinChance)
- History: 6 `HistPanel`/`HistLabel` pairs, all `visible = false` at start, shown one-by-one as rolls accumulate
- Stats row: MultBox (read-only) | ModeToggleBtn (Button — click to toggle Over/Under, shows current mode + threshold on two lines) | WinChanceBox (read-only)

**Color theme:** Town 3 Green room — bg `Color(0.031, 0.157, 0.063, 1)`, accent `Color(0.220, 0.659, 0.345, 1)`

BackButton wired (→ MainMenu, temporary until Town3 is built).

### Mines (`scenes/games/mines/`)

Minefield game. Player bets, picks grid size and mine count, then reveals tiles one by one. Cash out anytime after the first safe reveal. Hit a mine — lose the bet. True odds, no house edge.

**Grid sizes:** 25 (5×5), 36 (6×6), 49 (7×7), 64 (8×8) — four buttons above the mine slider, all lock during a game. Switching size rebuilds the grid procedurally and clamps mine count if needed. Tile pixel sizes: 76 / 68 / 60 / 52 px.

**Mine count:** `HSlider` (1 to grid_size−1). Left label = "Safe N" (green), right label = "N Mines" (red). Updates live while dragging. Locks during play.

**Multiplier — true hypergeometric odds (no house edge):**
```gdscript
func _multiplier(k: int) -> float:
    # k = number of safe tiles revealed so far
    var s := float(grid_size - mine_count)
    var result := 1.0
    for i in k:
        result *= float(grid_size - i) / (s - float(i))
    return result
# = ∏(i=0..k-1)[ (grid_size - i) / (safe_tiles - i) ]
```

**State machine:** IDLE → PLAYING → GAME_OVER → IDLE
- IDLE: bet, grid size, mine count all editable
- PLAYING: tiles clickable; Cash Out button enabled only after ≥1 safe reveal
- GAME_OVER: full board revealed; "New Game" resets everything

**Board reveal (`_reveal_all()`):** Triggered on mine hit AND on perfect game (all safe tiles found). Every tile flips — safe tiles show Lucky Lou (green border), mines show Tilt Tony (red border). Manual Cash Out mid-game does NOT reveal the board.

**Tile visuals:** 25–64 `Button` nodes built procedurally in `_build_grid()`. Styles set via `add_theme_stylebox_override()` with runtime `StyleBoxFlat` objects:
- Unrevealed: `Color(0.094, 0.063, 0.031)` bg, `Color(0.659, 0.408, 0.125)` amber border
- Safe: `Color(0.063, 0.157, 0.094)` dark green bg, `Color(0.220, 0.471, 0.282)` border — Lucky Lou fills tile
- Mine: `Color(0.157, 0.047, 0.047)` dark red bg, `Color(0.471, 0.188, 0.188)` border — Tilt Tony fills tile
- Icons: `btn.icon = texture`, `btn.expand_icon = true` — no text, image fills the button

**Character assets:**
- Safe: `res://Assets/Lucky Lou/download1.png` — green/gold friendly chip character
- Mine: `res://Assets/Tilt Tony/Tilt Tony no background.png` — red/gold angry chip character
- Loaded via `load()` in `_ready()`, assigned per-tile at reveal time

**Layout:**
- 880×580 centred rectangle via `CenterContainer`; 33/66 HBox split (`stretch_ratio` 1.0 / 2.0)
- Left column: Bet Amount → BetInput + ½/2× → Grid Size row (4 buttons) → Mines label → Mine slider row (SafeLabel | HSlider | MineLabel) → Start / Cash Out / New Game → Total Return caption → PayoutLabel → NextLabel → VExpand
- Right column: VExpand → TileGrid (GridContainer, `columns = sqrt(grid_size)`, `size_flags_horizontal = 4` SHRINK_CENTER) → VExpand
- `< Back` button: **anchored top-left of the root Control** (`offset` 10/10/105/46), `z_index = 10` — NOT inside LeftVBox

**Color theme:** Town 4 Brink amber/brown — bg `Color(0.157, 0.094, 0.031, 1)`, panel `Color(0.188, 0.125, 0.063, 1)`, accent `Color(0.659, 0.408, 0.125, 1)`

BackButton → MainMenu (temporary until Town4 scene is built).

### Tower (`scenes/games/tower/`)

Climbing risk game. Player picks one safe tile per row across 9 rows to climb the tower. Cash out anytime after the first safe pick. Hit a bomb — lose the bet. True odds, no house edge.

**Difficulty table (OptionButton dropdown):**
| Difficulty | Columns | Traps | Safe | Mult/row |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Easy   | 4 | 1 | 3 | 1.33× |
| Medium | 3 | 1 | 2 | 1.5×  |
| Hard   | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2×    |
| Expert | 3 | 2 | 1 | 3×    |
| Master | 4 | 3 | 1 | 4×    |

**Multiplier:** `pow(cols / safe, rows_cleared)` — true odds per row compounded

**Bomb placement:** fully random every game via `order.shuffle()` on column indices — no patterns to memorize

**Row reveal:**
- Safe pick → only the clicked tile goes green; unclicked tiles in that row go dark grey (inactive look)
- Bomb hit OR cash out / perfect game → full board reveals (all rows flip to Lucky Lou / Tilt Tony)

**Tile visuals:** Same Lucky Lou (safe) and Tilt Tony (bomb) images as Mines. Grey style added for completed rows: `Color(0.071, 0.071, 0.071)` bg / `Color(0.157, 0.157, 0.157)` border.

**Grid rebuild:** `_build_grid()` called on difficulty change — clears old children with `queue_free()`, rebuilds with new column count. `_on_difficulty_selected()` locked during play.

**OptionButton popup:** styled in code via `risk_option.get_popup()` — amber theme matching left panel buttons.

**Layout:** 880×580 centred rectangle; 33/66 HBox split. Left column: Bet + ½/2× → Risk dropdown → Start/Cash Out/New Game → Total Return → Next multiplier label. Right column: VBoxContainer `TileGrid` (rows added top→bottom in reverse order so row 0 = bottom of tower visually).

**Variable name note:** `_sb_popup` (StyleBoxFlat) and `_style_popup()` (function) — different names to avoid GDScript name clash.

**Color theme:** Town 4 Brink amber/brown — same as Mines.

BackButton → MainMenu (temporary until Town4 scene is built).

### Roulette (`scenes/games/roulette/`)

American roulette. Player places chips on the betting board, then spins. Board slides down, wheel slides up. Ball decelerates and lands in a pocket. Result shown on wheel and board. True odds — no house edge.

**Three-script design:**
- `roulette_wheel.gd` — `extends Control`, pure `_draw()` renderer. Draws 38 colored pockets, dividers, hub rings, ball, gold pointer at 12 o'clock using `_fill_circle()` helper (high-poly fan polygon for smooth edges at any size). Exports `wheel_rot`, `ball_angle`, `show_ball`, `lit_num`. Call `queue_redraw()` externally to animate.
- `roulette.gd` — all game logic: chip selection, bet placement, spin math, tween animation, payout, history.
- `chip_overlay.gd` — transparent `Control` node placed over the number grid. Intercepts mouse input for straight/split/corner bets, draws placed chips as layered circles. `extends Control`, `signal bet_requested(key: String)`.

**American roulette wheel order (clockwise from 12 o'clock, 37 = "00"):**
```gdscript
[0, 28, 9, 26, 30, 11, 7, 20, 32, 17, 5, 22, 34, 15, 3,
 24, 36, 13, 1, 37, 27, 10, 25, 29, 12, 8, 19, 31, 18,
 6, 21, 33, 16, 4, 23, 35, 14, 2]
```

**Red numbers:** `[1,3,5,7,9,12,14,16,18,19,21,23,25,27,30,32,34,36]`

**Bet types and payouts (true odds, no house edge):**
| Bet | Covers | Payout |
|---|---|---|
| Straight (n_0, n_00, n_1..n_36) | 1 number | 35:1 |
| Split (sp\|n_X\|n_Y) | 2 adjacent numbers | 17:1 |
| Corner (co\|n_A\|n_B\|n_C\|n_D) | 4 numbers at intersection | 8:1 |
| Column (col_1/2/3) | 12 numbers | 2:1 |
| Dozen (dozen_1/2/3) | 12 numbers | 2:1 |
| Red / Black / Odd / Even / Low / High | 18 numbers | 1:1 |

**Chip denominations:** $10, $25, $50, $100, $500 — chip selector in left panel. Multiple bets on different cells allowed simultaneously.

**Board layout (built procedurally in `_build_board()`):**
- Outer `HBoxContainer` (`_num_vbox`) holds a `zero_vbox` and `num_inner` side by side. Chip overlay is sized to this container.
- `zero_vbox` (VBoxContainer): 0 and 00 buttons with `SIZE_EXPAND_FILL` vertically — they stretch to span the full 3-row height, filling the gap down to the 1st 12 row.
- `num_inner` (VBoxContainer, `SIZE_EXPAND_FILL` horizontal): 3 HBoxContainers, each with 12 number buttons + a 2:1 column button.
- Dozen row: 1st 12 / 2nd 12 / 3rd 12 (36px fixed spacer aligns with zero column)
- Outside row: 1-18 / Even / Red / Black / Odd / 19-36
- All cells built as `Button` nodes in `bet_btns` dictionary keyed by bet string

**Chip overlay (`chip_overlay.gd`) — critical architecture:**
- `mouse_filter = MOUSE_FILTER_PASS` (1) — events propagate to parents only, NOT siblings
- Sized to `_num_vbox` only (not full board) so outside bet rows are unobstructed and receive input directly
- `init_grid(btn_map)` calls `_reg(key, bmap, col, row)` for n_0/n_00/numbers — registers in `_crects`, `_grid`, `_posmap`
- `_reg_plain(key, bmap)` registers col_1/col_2/col_3 in `_crects` ONLY — routes clicks to `_on_bet_placed` without participating in split/corner adjacency
- Number buttons have `mouse_filter = MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE` — overlay owns all their input
- 2:1 column buttons also have `mouse_filter = MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE` — overlay routes via `_reg_plain`
- Split key format: `"sp|n_X|n_Y"` (sorted). Corner key: `"co|n_A|n_B|n_C|n_D"` (sorted)
- `THRESH = 9.0` px from cell edge triggers split/corner detection
- Gap fallback: nearest-cell search using `clampf` distance within `THRESH * 2.5` — lets corner clicks from the dead-center of 4 cells work
- `_reg()` uses `gr.position - global_position` (NOT `to_local()` — that's Node2D only)

**`_draw()` in chip_overlay.gd:**
- Hover highlight rect (gold, alpha 0.22)
- Split hints: faint strips along borders that have adjacent valid cells
- Chips: `_draw_chip()` — drop shadow + body + bevel ring + white rim + dark center circle + amount text
- Chip color/value constants match roulette.gd exactly

**Slide animation:**
- `BoardView` (full-screen Control) fades to 0.25 opacity; `WheelView` slides up over it (0.4s cubic)
- Return: reversed — wheel exits downward, board fades back to full opacity
- Spin: 7.0s `TRANS_CUBIC EASE_OUT` for both wheel and ball

**Spin math:** same canonical `wheel_exact_rot` approach as Wheel game — prevents float drift across multiple spins. `+0.5 * seg_angle` added so pocket CENTER (not edge) lands under the pointer.

**Result display:** winning pocket glows gold (`lit_num`). Large result number + win profit label shown below wheel (`+$X` shows profit from winning bets only — correctly shows wins even when other bets cancel net). After 2.5s, returns to board with winning cell highlighted gold for 1.5s.

**Win label logic — important:** sums `wagered * _payout_mult(key)` for all WINNING bets only. Does NOT compute net. This correctly shows e.g. "+$200" when betting Black and a single red number and landing black, even though net gain is $0 after the red straight bet loss.

**History:** last 8 results shown as colored bubbles top-right of board, newest on left. Fixed `custom_minimum_size = Vector2(0, 28)` prevents layout shift when history is first populated.

**GDScript type-inference fixes required:**
- All untyped array loops must use `for x : Type in array` syntax or typed `Array[T]` declarations
- Ternary assignments: `var x : StyleBoxFlat = a if cond else b` — not `:=`
- `_num_vbox` typed as `Control` (not `VBoxContainer`) since it's now an HBoxContainer at runtime

**Layout:** 960×580 centred rectangle; left panel (160px min-width) + board fills remaining space. `< Back` anchored top-left, z_index=10.

**Color theme:** Town 3 The Odds green room — bg `Color(0.031, 0.157, 0.063, 1)`, accent `Color(0.220, 0.659, 0.345, 1)`.

BackButton → MainMenu (temporary until Town3 scene is built).

## Code Conventions

- **Scene node references**: use `%NodeName` syntax (unique name) — never long `$Path/To/Node` chains
- **Mark nodes** that are script-referenced with `unique_name_in_owner = true` in the `.tscn`
- **Formatting**: `_fmt(val: float) -> String` helper exists in both game scripts for comma-separated numbers — copy it into new game scripts, do not import
- **State machines**: use `enum State { IDLE, ACTIVE }` pattern — both current games use this
- **Minimum bet**: `MIN_BET = 10.0` — enforce in all games
- **TOWN_ID**: each game scene has a `const TOWN_ID` matching its town index (0–4)
- No comments unless the WHY is non-obvious
- No house edge — ever

---

## Visual Style

- GBA pixel art aesthetic — flat colors, hard edges, limited palette
- UI panels use `StyleBoxFlat` with `corner_radius = 0` (no rounding) and a 2–3px border
- **All RGB values are GBA 15-bit snapped** — each channel = `(n * 8) / 255` for integer n ∈ [0, 31]
  - Formula: `gba_val = round(target * 31)`, `godot_float = gba_val * 8 / 255`
  - Max white = 31/31 = `248/255 ≈ 0.973` — never use 1.0 for "white"

**Semantic colors (GBA-snapped, used across all games):**
- Balance text: `Color(0.376, 0.973, 0.502, 1)` — bright green (win)
- Fame text: `Color(0.502, 0.753, 0.973, 1)` — bright blue
- Title / gold: `Color(0.973, 0.847, 0.188, 1)` — gold
- Result yellow: `Color(0.973, 0.973, 0.439, 1)` — neutral result
- Win green: `Color(0.376, 0.973, 0.502, 1)` — positive outcome
- Loss red: `Color(0.973, 0.376, 0.376, 1)` — negative outcome
- Dim labels: `Color(0.627, 0.627, 0.753, 1)` — muted purple-gray

**Per-game room themes (background + accent divider):**
- **Town 1 — Blue room** (HiLo, CoinFlip): bg `Color(0.031, 0.063, 0.188, 1)` · accent `Color(0.220, 0.345, 0.659, 1)`
- **Town 2 — Red room** (Wheel, Plinko): bg `Color(0.157, 0.031, 0.031, 1)` · accent `Color(0.659, 0.220, 0.220, 1)`
- **Town 3 — Green room** (Dice, Roulette): bg `Color(0.031, 0.157, 0.063, 1)` · accent `Color(0.220, 0.659, 0.345, 1)`
- **Town 4 — Amber/Brown room** (Mines, Tower): bg `Color(0.157, 0.094, 0.031, 1)` · panel `Color(0.188, 0.125, 0.063, 1)` · accent `Color(0.659, 0.408, 0.125, 1)`
- Main Menu stays purple: bg uses procedural tilemap · panel border `Color(0.314, 0.220, 0.565, 1)`

## Main Menu (`scenes/main_menu/`)

Scrolling Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen-style tilemap background with a centered dark panel.

### `main_menu_bg.gd` — Background renderer

**Current:** Live SubViewport pan over `Town1.tscn`. Instances Town1, disables the Player (`process_mode = DISABLED`, `visible = false`, `player_cam.enabled = false`), adds its own `Camera2D` at zoom=2 and calls `make_current()`. Camera bounces diagonally at `Vector2(40, 15)` px/s within world bounds `(320,180)–(960,972)`. `handle_input_locally = false` on the SubViewport so no input leaks.

**Old (replaced):** Procedural 128×96 tile map — kept in git history but no longer used. Generated a scrolling FR/LG-style world with 18 tile types drawn via `draw_texture_rect`. Replaced because showing the real Town1 is more impressive and stays in sync as the world is built.

**18 tile types (`enum T`):**
```
GRASS, TALL_GRASS, FLOWER          — ground variants
TREE, ROCK                         — sprite overlays (GRASS drawn beneath in _draw)
WATER, WATER_EDGE                  — ocean / pond fill / shoreline
SAND, SAND_EDGE                    — sandy beach / cliff-to-sand transition
PATH, PATH_EDGE                    — gravel connecting paths
TOWN_FLOOR                         — bright teal interior ground
BLDG_ROOF_R, BLDG_ROOF_P, BLDG_ROOF_Y  — red / purple / gold roofs
BLDG_WALL                          — cream wall tile with two windows
CLIFF, CLIFF_BASE                  — upper cliff cap / lower cliff face
```

**Tile sources:**
- Asset-sourced (from `Assets/Floor TIles/`): `GRASS`, `TALL_GRASS`, `TREE` (Tree_Pine_2_16x16), `ROCK`, `PATH`, `PATH_EDGE`
- Programmatically generated (FR/LG palette): all others — water, cliffs, sand, town, buildings, flowers

**FR/LG palette used in generators (do not change without visual check):**
- Water deep: `Color(0.20, 0.44, 0.86)` — bright Pokémon ocean blue
- Cliff top: `Color(0.74, 0.57, 0.33)` — warm tan
- Cliff base: `Color(0.58, 0.40, 0.20)` — darker brown
- Town floor: `Color(0.47, 0.79, 0.47)` — iconic FR/LG teal-green
- Sand: `Color(0.80, 0.68, 0.40)` — warm beige
- Flower red: `Color(0.92, 0.22, 0.18)` — scattered 3-petal flowers
- Building wall: `Color(0.95, 0.93, 0.86)` — cream with blue-framed windows
- Roofs: parametric — `_gen_roof(Color)` with lightened ridge + darkened shadow

**Map layout:**
- Two-layer cliff border wraps entire map (CLIFF_BASE outer 2 tiles, CLIFF inner 2 tiles)
- Sandy beach ring just inside cliffs (SAND_EDGE + SAND, d=4 and d=5)
- 18 forest clusters scattered across the map
- 5 towns with teal floors, gravel paths, coloured buildings (roofs in rows, walls beneath)
- 5 gravel paths connecting towns (horizontal + vertical, 2 tiles wide with PATH_EDGE borders)
- 6 water ponds placed at fixed coordinates for visual variety
- 28 scattered rocks on open grass

**`_draw()` two-pass logic:** TREE and ROCK tiles draw GRASS beneath them first (transparency handling), then the overlay sprite on top.

**Critical:** `posmod()` / `fposmod()` wrapping used throughout. Map indices are always `% MAP_W` / `% MAP_H` — never read out of bounds.

### `main_menu.gd`
Connects New Game (→ `HiLo.tscn`, temporary until overworld exists) and Quit.

### `MainMenu.tscn` node tree
```
MainMenu (Control, main_menu.gd)
  Background (Control, main_menu_bg.gd, mouse_filter=IGNORE)
  DarkOverlay (ColorRect, Color(0,0,0,0.28), mouse_filter=IGNORE)
  Center (CenterContainer, full anchors)
    MenuPanel (PanelContainer, min 360px wide, styled dark purple)
      VBox
        TitleLabel  — "BUST", 60px gold
        SubLabel    — "A Gambling Adventure", 15px muted
        Divider     — 2px purple rule
        Spacer      — 8px
        NewGameButton (unique_name) — styled with hover gold border
        QuitButton    (unique_name) — styled with hover gold border
  VersionLabel — bottom-left, "v0.1 — Early Development"
```

**To activate the main menu**: In Godot editor → Project → Project Settings → Application → Run → Main Scene → set to `res://scenes/main_menu/MainMenu.tscn`.

## Session Notes — Last worked on: 2026-05-20

### Wheel game — fully playable, all bugs resolved

- Rebuilt `Wheel.tscn` from scratch (HiLo-style VBoxContainer layout)
- New `Assets/Wheel/Wheel.png` and `Assets/Wheel/SpinBtn.png` integrated
- `SpinButton` is a `TextureButton` (not `Button`) — typed as `BaseButton` in script
- `PivotMarker` approach for reliable pivot_offset — await 2 frames in `_ready()`
- `wheel_overlay.gd` draws gold pointer triangle, 12px above wheel top edge
- `WheelContainer` locked in editor (`metadata/_edit_lock_ = true`)
- `randomize()` called in `_ready()` for proper RNG seeding
- Landing formula: `land_r = -float(win_idx) * seg_angle` (no +0.5 for this PNG)
- **Float-precision bug fully resolved**: `wheel_exact_rot` canonical variable + `wheel_image.rotation = start_r` before tween. See Spin Math section above for full details.

### Wheel overhaul — Wheel2.png + new segments

- Switched texture from `Wheel.png` to `Wheel2.png` in `Wheel.tscn`
- New SEGMENTS array to match Wheel2.png layout (see Wheel section above)
- `SPIN_AGAIN_IDX: Array[int] = [0, 10]` — 1x segments no longer auto-respin
- `_on_spin_complete` checks `if win_idx in SPIN_AGAIN_IDX` (not `mult == 1.0`)
- 0x result text changed to "0x  -$X" (was "No win — -$X")
- Deleted orphaned files: `wheel_draw.gd`, `wheel_clip.gdshader`, their `.uid` files

### GBA 15-bit color palette — applied across all files

- Every RGB color value in all `.tscn` and `.gd` files snapped to GBA 15-bit (n×8/255, n ∈ 0–31)
- Per-game room themes introduced: blue for Town 1 (HiLo, CoinFlip), red for Town 2 (Wheel, Plinko)
- Main menu remains purple

### Plinko — overhaul complete

- Switched from physics simulation to discrete binomial random walk — eliminates edge bias (physics momentum carry-over fakes non-binomial distribution)
- `_weighted_bucket()` uses `C(12,k)` weights; `_build_path()` shuffles coin flips for correct visual path
- Parabolic arc tween: x=lerp, y=t² per step — natural gravity feel without physics
- Path waypoints are midpoints between consecutive peg positions — ball arcs through gaps, never covers pegs
- `BALL_SCALE = 0.22` (18px effective), `STEP_TIME = 0.11s`, drop ≈ 1.6s
- Purple gradient bucket theme matching commercial Plinko reference
- MULTS updated: `[170, 24, 8.1, 2, 0.7, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.7, 2, 8.1, 24, 170]`
- `_fmt_mult` fixed: integer check → `"170x"`, float → `"8.1x"` / `"0.7x"`
- Top 2 peg rows hidden (draw loop `range(2, ROWS)`) — visual clean-up; colliders intact for all 12 rows

### Main Menu — fully built

- Procedural scrolling FR/LG-style background (`main_menu_bg.gd`) — 18 tile types, FR/LG palette, towns with buildings, forest clusters, water ponds, sandy cliff borders
- `MainMenu.tscn` + `main_menu.gd` complete — styled panel, gold title, hover-state buttons
- Trees switched to `Tree_Pine_2_16x16` (32×32) to avoid crown cutoff at screen edges
- All tile colours matched to Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Four Island reference

### Town1 + Player — first overworld scene built

- `scenes/player/Player.tscn` — reusable `CharacterBody2D`: `AnimatedSprite2D` (4-directional idle/walk from SVG atlas), `CircleShape2D` collision, `Camera2D` (zoom=2, position smoothing)
- `player.gd` — dominant-axis 4-directional movement at 200px/s; tracks `_facing` enum for correct idle animation on stop; `idle left` mirrors `idle right` with `flip_h`
- `scenes/Towns/Town1.tscn` — 20×18 tile map (1280×1152px), `TileMapLayer` with 64×64 grass atlas (4 variants), 2 game buildings, player spawns at (640, 576)
- `town1.gd` — `@tool` script: fixed-seed fill in editor (stable view), randomized at runtime; camera limits clamped to map bounds; door triggers use `call_deferred` to avoid physics callback errors
- `HiLoBuilding` + `CoinFlipBuilding` — `StaticBody2D` each with `Sprite2D`, body collision, and `Area2D` door trigger → `call_deferred("change_scene_to_file", ...)`
- Buildings: `Assets/Buildings/HiLo.png` + `CoinFlip.png` — both 256×192px (4×3 tiles), log cabin style
- BackButton in HiLo and CoinFlip now returns to `Town1.tscn` (was MainMenu)

### Dice — fully built and polished

- Two-script design: `dice_slider.gd` (custom Control — draw + drag) + `dice.gd` (logic)
- 10,000 result possibilities (0.00–99.99) via `float(randi_range(0, 9999)) / 100.0`
- Threshold clamped 2–98; smooth ball scroll animation (`EASE_OUT / TRANS_CUBIC`, 1.4s) from right edge to landing position
- Result circle (R=30, 60px) with result number inside (font_size 14, white) follows ball live above the track; colour is win/loss green/red and updates live as ball crosses threshold
- Circle **stays on the line between rolls** — cleared only when next Place Bet is pressed
- `ModeToggleBtn` disabled during animation to prevent mid-roll mode changes; re-enabled 0.3s after landing
- History panels (×6) hidden at start, revealed one-by-one as rolls accumulate; newest entry (index 0) fades in over 0.35s
- Win/loss dollar amounts removed from UI — balance update is silent; ResultLabel only shows input errors
- Layout: 860×520 centred rectangle via CenterContainer; 33/66 HBox split; Payout centred above Place Bet
- True odds, no house edge: multiplier = `1 / win_chance`
- BackButton → MainMenu (temporary until Town3 scene is built)
- `var rx : float` explicit annotation in `dice_slider.gd` — required to fix GDScript type-inference parser error

### Navigation wired — all back buttons + New Game entry point

- Wheel `BackButton` → `Town1.tscn` (`unique_name_in_owner = true` added, `< Back` text, wired in `wheel.gd`)
- Plinko `BackButton` → `Town1.tscn` (was MainMenu)
- `main_menu.gd` New Game now loads `Town1.tscn` directly (was HiLo temp load)
- All five game scenes (HiLo, CoinFlip, Wheel, Plinko, Dice) now return somewhere sensible on back

### Mines — fully built and polished

- Full minefield game: IDLE / PLAYING / GAME_OVER state machine
- **Grid size selector**: 4 buttons (25 / 36 / 49 / 64) — all lock during a game, unlock on New Game; switching size rebuilds grid + clamps mine count
- **Mine count slider**: `HSlider` replaces old −/+ buttons; SafeLabel (green) + MineLabel (red) update live while dragging
- **Back button** moved to top-left corner of the screen (anchored, z_index 10) — not inside the left column
- **Action button** (Start / Cash Out / New Game) positioned between mine slider and payout display
- Tile images: Lucky Lou (`Assets/Lucky Lou/download1.png`) for safe tiles, Tilt Tony (`Assets/Tilt Tony/Tilt Tony no background.png`) for mines — set via `btn.icon` + `btn.expand_icon = true`
- `_reveal_all()`: flips every tile on mine hit AND on perfect game; manual mid-game Cash Out leaves board as-is
- Tile colors muted: safe bg `Color(0.063, 0.157, 0.094)` / mine bg `Color(0.157, 0.047, 0.047)` — darker, less saturated than original
- All tile styles built at runtime via `add_theme_stylebox_override()` — no StyleBoxFlat sub_resources in TSCN for tiles
- `add_theme_style_override` → `add_theme_stylebox_override` (Godot 4 correct API)
- Amber/brown Town 4 Brink theme throughout
- BackButton → MainMenu (temporary until Town4 is built)

### Town1 overworld — decoration pass complete (2026-05-19)

- **Pond** added — `Sprite2D` with `StaticBody2D` + `CollisionPolygon2D` (was Area2D, fixed to StaticBody2D so player is blocked)
- **LiquorStore** added — second decorative building with `StaticBody2D` + `CollisionShape2D`
- **PineTree + Bush scenes** created (`scenes/Towns/Objects/`) — both use `StaticBody2D` for collision
- **72-tree border** — `Decorations` group, trees every 64px along all four map edges (top/bottom 20 each, left/right 16 each)
- **Player z_index = 2** — fixed twice (Godot resets it when scene is resaved; must re-check after any editor save)
- **Tile size** settled at 32px, map 40×36 = 1280×1152 world

### Main Menu — live Town1 background (2026-05-19)

- `main_menu_bg.gd` fully rewritten — procedural tile map replaced with SubViewport rendering live Town1
- Player disabled in viewport: `process_mode = DISABLED`, `visible = false`, `player_cam.enabled = false`, `_cam.make_current()` — all four steps required or camera stays static
- `project.godot` main scene corrected: `HiLo.tscn` → `MainMenu.tscn`

### Tower — fully built (2026-05-20)

- OptionButton dropdown for difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard/Expert/Master) — replaces 3 risk buttons
- Variable column counts per difficulty; `_build_grid()` rebuilds grid on difficulty change
- Row reveal: safe pick greys out other tiles in completed row; bomb hit or cash out reveals entire board
- `_reveal_row()` + `_reveal_all()` helpers; `_set_tile_grey()` for completed row inactive style
- Master difficulty corrected: 4 cols / 3 traps / 1 safe (was 5/4)
- `_sb_popup` renamed from `_style_popup` to avoid GDScript name clash with `_style_popup()` function
- `var btn : Button = tile_rows[row][col]` — explicit type required (untyped Array inference fix)

### Roulette — fully built and polished (2026-05-20)

- Three-script design: `roulette_wheel.gd` + `roulette.gd` + `chip_overlay.gd`
- American roulette — 38 pockets (0, 00, 1-36), correct red/black/green coloring, authentic wheel order
- Betting board built procedurally in `_build_board()`:
  - `zero_vbox` holds 0/00 with `SIZE_EXPAND_FILL` vertical — spans full 3-row height, aligns flush with 1st 12 row
  - `num_outer` HBoxContainer is `_num_vbox` (typed `Control`) — chip overlay sized to this, not full board
  - 2:1 column buttons use `mouse_filter = MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE`; routed via `chip_overlay._reg_plain()`
- Chip selector ($10/$25/$50/$100/$500); multiple simultaneous bets including split and corner bets
- Split bets (17:1): click between 2 adjacent number cells. Corner bets (8:1): click intersection of 4 cells (dead-center also works via nearest-cell gap fallback)
- Chip visuals: chips drawn as layered circles with shadow, bevel ring, white rim, dark center, amount text. Hover highlight and split/corner hint strips on borders
- Slide animation: board fades to 0.25 opacity, wheel enters upward (0.4s cubic tween); reverses after result
- 7s spin animation (TRANS_CUBIC EASE_OUT); ball tweens independently
- Win label shows profit from winning bets only (not net) — correctly shows wins even when other bets cancel net gain
- Outside bets (red/black/dozen/etc.) work correctly — overlay sized to number-rows only so outside rows receive input directly
- History bubbles shown top-right; fixed minimum height prevents layout shift on first spin
- `chip_overlay.gd`: `mouse_filter = MOUSE_FILTER_PASS` (propagates to parents not siblings — critical architecture note)
- True odds — 35:1 straight, 17:1 split, 8:1 corner, 2:1 dozens/columns, 1:1 even-money bets
- Multiple GDScript type-inference fixes: typed `Array[String]`, `for num : int in array`, `: StyleBoxFlat =` ternary
